Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering



📌 Project Overview


This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and income patterns to help businesses understand different customer types and make data-driven decisions.




Customer segmentation is widely used in marketing, sales, and business analytics to improve customer targeting, personalized offers, and retention strategies

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Implementation of K-Means clustering

Visualization of customer clusters

Identification of distinct customer groups

Simple and beginner-friendly machine learning workflow



🛠️ Technologies Used



Python 3

NumPy – numerical computations

Pandas – data handling and analysis

Matplotlib – data visualization

Scikit-learn – K-Means clustering algorithm




📊 Dataset Description


The dataset contains customer-related information such as:




Annual Income

Spending Score / Purchasing Behavior


These features are used to group customers into meaningful clusters.


⚙️ How It Works



Load and explore the customer data

Preprocess and scale the features

Apply the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

Train the K-Means model

Visualize the resulting customer segments




📈 Output

Visual representation of customer clusters

Clearly defined customer segments such as:



High income – high spending

High income – low spending

Low income – high spending

Low income – low spending



🎯 Use Cases


Targeted marketing campaigns

Customer behavior analysis

Business decision-making

Beginner machine learning practice project


📌 Future Improvements


Add more customer features

Try different clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
